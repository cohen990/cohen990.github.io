Long overdue. I did this work almost a year ago and have been struggling to write out a blog post for it. 

Long story short - it worked

Swapping out the home-spun for Keras

Playing with the number of layers

Changing the type of error

Episodes
Epochs

It's not working. It's never really worked. How can I simplify?
Reduce problem scope - cut down to only 1 piece
O-tetromino tests - looping
L-tetromino tests - much more difficult to loop

Get it working with only one piece

The error was still climbing
why?
mean square logarithmic error

reintroduce all the pieces

IT WORKS!

Next steps?
In any game of tetris, you are able to see the next piece and plan ahead. That's the next step for my bot. It needs to be able to see the future.
