Bring back wasted time

I'm sat here with nothing to do and I've been disinsentived from putting any energy into innovation. Every time I have spent time on a anything other than tickets on the Jira board, I've been reprimanded. So now, in my downtime, I check facebook. I get more coffee. Let me waste my time. When you find out I've beens spending time investigating containerizing our services, don't tell me to drop it right away and we'll find something useful for you to do. Trust me that I am working to the good of the product. Tell me that when I come to a natural stopping point, write up what I've found and then pick up something from Jira. Let me waste my time and explore ideas and attempt to innovate. Don't try to corral me. When work is flowing through the board and when the pressure is high, I'm there to help and work on things. When things get quieter I still need to feel I have to freedom to expore ideas
